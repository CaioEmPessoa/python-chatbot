## Alibabot App
This was my first big project with python, and made for a project for school that later changed into a website, that we had put more effor into, you can check it on [this link](https://github.com/PedoroSantos/AlibabotProject)

With all that said, this program uses the openai API to act like their chatbot, but with additional features, like:
- Voice to text translation
- Change the color Theme
- Change the font size
- Change the font itself
