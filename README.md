Alibabot App

Alibabot was originally my first big project with Python, created for a school assignment. However, the projectâ€™s focus changed entirely, leading us to shift away from the chatbot concept and pivot toward developing a website. You can explore the website on [GitHub here](https://github.com/PedoroSantos/AlibabotProject).

Although the initial idea involved a chatbot using the OpenAI API, the final version of the app includes several interactive features, such as:

- Voice-to-text translation
- Customizable color themes
- Adjustable font size
- Option to change the font style
